# Markov Map Generator

## Introduction

My code generates a pixel art map using a Markov model. I intended for this to be a tool for creating fantasy worlds of some kind, such as for a written story, DND, or any other kind of fictional universe that someone might want to create.

## Color key

Green = grass

Dark green = forest

Yellow = sand

Blue = water

Light gray = low mountain

Dark gray = high mountain

## How to run

You can run the main file normally, either through an IDE or the terminal. A file will be generated in the images folder with the result. If you want to keep this file, either rename it or move it elsewhere on your device. Otherwise, the file will be rewritten next time the program is run.

## The future

I would have liked to have made the outputs resemble real maps more. The outputs are somewhat streaky and don't really resemble a real landscape. Another idea I had would be to name various features (i.e., rivers, mountain ranges, lakes, deserts, etc.). This could also be done with a Markov chain, either by chaining syllables together or by chaining individual letters. I wanted to display the names of each feature over the feature itself, just like in a real map.
